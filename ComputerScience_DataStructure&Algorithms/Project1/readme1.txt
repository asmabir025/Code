Starting the project was challenging. That is because of the ambiguous nature of to-do things. I was confused whether I should make only one base class and subclasses from this base class. But I ended up creating one base and 4 subclasses and one subclass out of a sublass from the base class. To be specific, Cd class is a baseclass of Book. I did this because both the Book and the Cd has same number of features (attributes) and similar required data types for these features. This eased creating Cd class. However, it slightly complicated coding in the inventory class. For example, when the item is Cd, I had to ensure to print out the type as Cd not Book. Then I thought of creating Cd class independent of Book. However, the complication was not too much- so I ended up not changing the original code. Also, this is the first time in any CS course I had to write codes to accomodate the output. Normally, I would be given instructions of what-to-do, not what-to-output. 

I think the phase is nicely built up. Creating items and using these items in inventory - it never felt complicated. The instructions were overall helpful, much better than lab instructions. I named every attribute according to the header of each csv files. I am also printing out each feature of an item according to the sequence in the header. So, my output slightly differed from output.txt as output.txt did not follow the sequence of headers in csv files. Overall, I have enjoyed working on phase one and finished my code in one sitting within 4 hours.
